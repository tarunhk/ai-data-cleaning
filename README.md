# 🧠 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to clean and preprocess raw data before using it for machine learning.  
The Titanic dataset is used to perform data cleaning, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and detect outliers.

Data preprocessing is an important step in machine learning because clean and well-prepared data improves model performance and accuracy.
